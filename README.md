# Fill sensing board control software

Reports fill level detected by hall sensors.

Runs on the fill sensing PCB (Bento). To load code onto the board:

* Open MPLAB X
* Connect a PICKIT 3 to your computer via USB
* Line up the PICKIT cable such that the red wire lines up with A) the arrow on the PICKIT, and B) the MCLR marking on the board.
* Power the board through the 5V bus input. The power from the PICKIT is not sufficient to power the entire board.
* Load the code onto the board using MPLAB.
